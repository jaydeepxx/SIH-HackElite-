            <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
            The botanical name of cucumber is Cucumis sativus. Cucumbers are originated in India. It is a climbing plant which is used as summer vegetable throughout in India. The cucumber fruit is eaten raw or is served as a salad or cooked as a vegetable. The seeds
            of cucumber are used for oil extraction which is good for body and brain. Cucumbers contain 96% water which is good in summer season. The plants are large sized, leaves are hairy and are triangular in shape and flowers are yellow in color.
            Cucumber is an excellent source of Mb (Molybdenum) and Vitamin K. Cucumber is used to cure skin problems, kidney and heart problems and is used as alkalizer.

            It can be sown in variety of soils ranging from sandy loam to heavy soil. But a loamy soil which is rich in organic matter and has well drainage system is best for the cucumber farming. The pH ranging from 6-7 is suited best for cucumber farming.

            <h3>SOWING </h3>
            <h4>Time of sowing </h4>
            It is sown in the month of February-March
        </div>
        <div class="image-responsive"> <img src="https://www.greenhousesensation.co.uk/media/wysiwyg/posadka-semyan-ogurca-na-rassadu.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt=""></div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4> Spacing</h4>
            <p>Sow two seeds per place of bed which is 2.5m wide and use spacing of 60cm between seeds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="img-responsive"> <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/cucumber-plantation-field-picture-id635766786" width="700" height="500" alt=""></div>
        <div class="content-crops">
            <h4>Sowing Depth</h4>
            Seeds are sown at the depth of 2-3cm
            <h4>Method of sowing</h4>
            • Low tunnel technology: This technology is used to produce early yield of cucumber in early summer. It helps to protect the crop from cold season i.e. in the month of December and January. Beds of 2.5m width are sown in the month of December. Seeds are
            sown both sides of the bed at the distance of 45cm. Before sowing supportive rods of 45-60cm length are fixed in the soil. Cover the field with plastic sheet (100 gauge thickness) with the help of support rods. Plastic sheet should be removed
            mainly in the month of February when temperature is suitable outside. • Dibbling method • Basing method • Layout in ring method
            <h4>Seed Rate</h4>
            Seed rate of 1.0 kg is sufficient for one acre of land
            <h4>Seed treatment</h4>
            Before sowing seeds, treat them with the suitable chemical to protect them from disease and pests and to increase viability. Seeds are treated with Captan@2gm before sowing.

            <h3>FERTILIZER</h3>
            Fertilizer Requirement (kg/acre): UREA SSP MOP 90 125 35 Nutrient Value (kg/acre): NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 40 20 20 At the time of land preparation apply fertilizer dose of Nitrogen @40kg (Urea@90kg), phosphorus @20kg (Single phosphate @125kg) and
            potassium@20kg (Muriate of potash@35kg) as a basal dose. At the time of sowing, apply one third of the Nitrogen dose along with Potassium and Single superphosphate. At the early stage of veins production i.e. one month of sowing apply rest
            of the dose.


            <div>
                <h3>WEED CONTROL</h3>
                Weed can be controlled by hand-hoeing and also controlled by chemically, use glyphosate@1.6litre per 150 litre of water. Use glyphosate only on weeds not on crop plants.
            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
                In summer season it requires frequent irrigation and in rainy season it does not require any irrigation. In total it requires 10-12 irrigations. Pre-irrigation is required before sowing then subsequent irrigation is required after 2-3 days of sowing.
                After second sowing, the crops are then irrigated at the interval of 4-5 days. Drip irrigation is very useful for this crop.
            </div>
            <div class="content-crops">
                <h3>HARVESTING</h3>
                Plants start yielding in about 45-50 days after sowing. Mainly 10-12 harvestings can be done. Harvesting is mainly done when the seed of cucumber are soft and the fruits are green and young. Harvesting is done with the help of sharp knife or any sharp
                object. It gives an average of 33-42qtl/acre of yield.
